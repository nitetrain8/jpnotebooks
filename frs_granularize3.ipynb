    "# I've decided not to force the user-set parameter to be \"locked\" if the hardware only supports 1 sensor.  For 3.0, all that will accomplish is giving a nice UI to a user who managed to change the globals via recipe (because I plan on making the Globals 1 2 and 3 defaults' user-set parameters match the hardware parameters).  And once the Web UI is updated to take advantage of this new scheme, it will not show sensor pairs if the hardware doesn't support 2 sensors.\n",
    "# As of now, implementing this would give us the following improvements:\n",
    "## After setting the \"SensorInputs\" parameters for Temp, DO and pH at the factory, we wouldn't have to worry about users messing up any other configuration.\n",
    "## In fact, users wouldn't have to access the Service UI to set which configuration of sensors they're using - the \"SensorConfig\" parameters for Temp, DO and pH would be set in the Web UI's Select Sensors menu\n",
    "## If the user has 2 sensors configured, and 1 is inactive but in range, and the 2nd goes out of range, control switches to the 1st sensor, instead of entering \"broken sensor\" mode.  This is for a situation where the user hasn't yet been able to respond to the 1st sensor failure.\n",
    "## Users are prevented from changing the preferred sensor or re-enabling a sensor when the lock is closed\n",
    "## When a user clicks the slider to select an inactive sensor (i.e. it has a DNE on it), the backend software will not only change the user-preferred sensor but also re-activate that sensor.\n",
    "## If this information is sent in the getVersion call, future versions of the Web UI can use it to determine which sensors to show in the Select Sensors menu and the Calibration menu (currently, that decision is based on the Model).\n",
