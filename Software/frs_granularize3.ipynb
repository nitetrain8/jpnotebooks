On these units, config files must be either transferred by hand (slow and error-prone) or they must be configured by a Windows account admin (requiring IT support). Currently, only a customer's IT personnel are expected to have access to the Windows admin account rather than process administrators. Simplifying this process would reduce error rates and make it easier for customers to ensure configuration uniformity across multiple bioreactors. \n",

      "For example, a customer may have units A and B with custom configurations for Logger Settings, Alarms, and System Variables. To transfer these settings to unit C, they have to manually transfer the files to the correct locations, reboot the RIO, reboot the Shell UI, and ensure that they didn't do anything in the wrong order that might cause the files to be accidentally overridden. A builtin mechanism to perform this process would greatly simplify it. \n",

      "The URS is pretty straight forward, but the FRS goes a bit all over the place and may need some fixing up. Fundamentally, both import and export are simple directory copies of config files from one set of folders to the other. The complexity comes mostly from doing sanity checks on folder structure, file structure, edge cases, permissions, and customizing behavior. Export from recorder.exe and Desktop UI should be identical, with whatever special name we use for factory set defaults. Users should also be able to import settings straight to the local backup folder. \n",

      "Folders end in \".pbssettings\" mostly for cosmetic reasons. Originally I was going to require it and have both import and export only operate on \".pbssettings\" folders, but I backed down. The idea was that we would strictly control the contents of what goes in each settings folder so that users had less of a chance of shooting themselves in the foot. In practice, they should only be importing or exporting anyway without modifying files by hand, so it should be fine either way. \n",
